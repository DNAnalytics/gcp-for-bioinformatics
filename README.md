# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics
This repository covers using ☁️Google Cloud Platform public cloud services for bioinformatics data analysis tasks.  The guidance is intended for researchers - in particular, this guide is for those who are **NEW to working with ☁️GCP**.  The info is based on advisory work my team has done with the following groups:

1) The Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA) - [link](https://www.broadinstitute.org)
2) CSIRO Bioinformatics (Sydney, Australia) - [link](https://bioinformatics.csiro.au/)
3) Nextflow.io team (Barcelona, Spain) - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/about-us.html)
4) EMBL-EBI (Cambridge, UK) - [link](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)
5) Galaxy Project (Europe) - [link](https://galaxyproject.org/cloud/)

### Why should I use a public cloud vendor for bioinformatics?

- 📗Read top 4 most [common use cases](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics/blob/master/USING.md) for using the public cloud for bioinformatics researchers
- 📗Read the [FAQ for GCP bioinformatics](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics/blob/master/FAQ.md)
- 📕Read Nature magazine: ["Cloud computing for genomic data analysis and collaboration"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.113)
- ⭐️Top Reasons:
    - Be able to run large (or huge) sized analysis jobs when and only when you need to run them
    - Save time & money by using vendor-managed infrastructure -> get analysis results faster
