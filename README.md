# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics
This repository covers using ☁️Google Cloud Platform public cloud services for bioinformatics data analysis tasks.  The guidance is intended for researchers - in particular, this guide is for those who are **NEW to working with GCP**.  The info is based on advisory work my team has done with the groups shown below:

### Why would I choose to use a public cloud vendor for bioinformatics?

[![flow-cell](/images/flow-cell.jpg)]() 

- ⭐️Top Reasons:
    - **Save Money** - run scaled analysis jobs exactly & only when you need to run them
    - **Save Time** - use vendor-managed infrastructure & best-practice patterns for repeatable research -> get analysis results faster
- 📗READ the [FAQ for GCP bioinformatics](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics/blob/master/FAQ.md) for this Repo
