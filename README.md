# GCP for Bioinformatics
This repository contains information about using Google Cloud Platform services for data analysis tasks.  The guidance is intended for bioinformatics researchers - in particular, for those who are new to working with GCP.  The information is based on advisory work my team has done with the following groups and organizations:

1) The Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA - [link](https://www.broadinstitute.org)
2) CSIRO Bioinformatics in Sydney, Australia - [link](https://bioinformatics.csiro.au/)
3) Nextflow.io team in Barcelona, Spain - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/about-us.html)
4) EMBL-EBI in Cambridge, UK - [link](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)
