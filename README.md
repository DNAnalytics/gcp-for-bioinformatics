# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics
This repository covers using ☁️Google Cloud Platform public cloud services for bioinformatics data analysis tasks.  The guidance is intended for researchers - in particular, this guide is for those who are **NEW to working with ☁️GCP**.  The info is based on advisory work my team has done with the following groups:

1) The Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA) - [link](https://www.broadinstitute.org)
2) CSIRO Bioinformatics (Sydney, Australia) - [link](https://bioinformatics.csiro.au/)
3) Nextflow.io team (Barcelona, Spain) - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/about-us.html)
4) EMBL-EBI (Cambridge, UK) - [link](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)
5) Galaxy Project (Europe) - [link](https://galaxyproject.org/cloud/)

### Why should I use a public cloud vendor for bioinformatics?

- ⭐️Top Reasons:
    - **Save Money** - run scaled analysis jobs exactly and only when you need to run them
    - **Save Time** - use vendor-managed infrastructure and best-practice patterns for repeatable research -> get analysis results faster
