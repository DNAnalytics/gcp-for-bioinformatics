# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for Bioinformatics
This repository covers using ‚òÅÔ∏èGoogle Cloud Platform public cloud services for bioinformatics data analysis tasks.  The guidance is intended for researchers - in particular, this guide is for those who are **NEW to working with ‚òÅÔ∏èGCP**.  The info is based on advisory work my team has done with the following groups:

1) The Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA) - [link](https://www.broadinstitute.org)
2) CSIRO Bioinformatics (Sydney, Australia) - [link](https://bioinformatics.csiro.au/)
3) Nextflow.io team (Barcelona, Spain) - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/about-us.html)
4) EMBL-EBI (Cambridge, UK) - [link](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/)
5) Galaxy Project (Europe) - [link](https://galaxyproject.org/cloud/)

### Why should I use a public cloud vendor for bioinformatics?

- üìóRead [common use cases for using the public cloud for bioinformatics researchers](https://github.com/lynnlangit/gcp-for-bioinformatics/blob/master/USING.md)
- üìïRead article in Nature magazine: ["Cloud computing for genomic data analysis and collaboration"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2017.113)
- ‚≠êÔ∏èTop Reasons:
    - Be able to run large (or huge) sized analysis jobs when and only when you need to run them
    - Save time & money by using vendor-managed infrastructure -> get analysis results faster

NOTE: Each page of this Repo [Topics list]() includes the following:  
1. A short description of why, what, how to use the ‚òÅÔ∏èGCP service
2. A short linked screencast showing how to use the ‚òÅÔ∏èGCP service.   Here is the link to all of the screencasts for this Repo - as a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Q4HssKcxYvcixWS08UFaYIH7y4IAV0z)

### Diagram of key GCP Services for Bioinformatics

Shown below is a basic pattern for performing genomic analysis jobs (also called pipelines or workflows) on ‚òÅÔ∏è GCP. Each blue icon represents a type of ‚òÅÔ∏èGCP service.  In this guide, you'll read how to get started with the services shown below.  In addition to the topic coverage, listed below a direct set of links to answer the most commonly asked questions.
