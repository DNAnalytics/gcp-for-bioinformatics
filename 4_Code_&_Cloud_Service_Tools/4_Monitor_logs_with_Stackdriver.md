### Why do this
 - You want to understand whether your service instance is working as expected
 - You want to see any error message or output logs from your service
 - You want to understand if your service configuration fits your analysis workload size

### What is this
 - Using the GCP Stackdriver service to read and aggregate your GCP service log files
 - Using Stackdriver to do customized monitoring, i.e. alerts on performance conditions

### Key considerations
 - Most GCE services integrate with Stackdriver, so that service logs can be more easily read
 - Advanced Stackdriver capabilities are billed for additional service charges

### How to do this
 - Click any link 'View in Stackdriver' in a service console for GCP
 - Navigate to the Stackdriver console to see standard service metrics and to perfrom custom actions

### How to verify you've done it
