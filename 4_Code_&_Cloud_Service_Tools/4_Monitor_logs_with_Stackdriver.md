# Monitor logs with GCP Operations (was Stackdriver)

### Why do this
 - UNDERSTAND whether your service instance is working as expected
 - SEE any error message or output logs from your service
 - UNDERSTAND if your service configuration fits your analysis workload size

### What is this
 - USE the GCP Operations service (was Stackdriver) to read and aggregate your GCP service log files
 - USE Operations to do customized monitoring, i.e. alerts on performance conditions

### Key considerations
 - Most GCE services integrate with Operations, so that service logs can be more easily read
 - Advanced Operations capabilities are billed for additional service charges

### How to do this
 - CLICK any link 'View in Operations' in a service console for GCP
 - NAVIGAGE to the Operations console to see standard service metrics and to perfrom custom actions

### How to verify you've done it
 - START and run a service, click to view the service execution log in Stackdriver 
 - FILTER, sort or search within logs using the Stackdriver interface

Click the button highlighted in red to open the Stackdriver logs.
