# SQL Lessons


### Why do this
 - Learn SQL query concepts so that you can use Google Cloud Big Query service

### What is this
 - SQL query concepts

### Key considerations
 - SQL is used widely for querying data stored in relational tables

### How to do this
- Sign up for a Google Cloud account (can use free trial credits if new account)
- Create a Google Cloud Project and then enable the BigQuery service for that project
- Navigate to the BigQuery Web UI for your Google Cloud Project
- Review the example BigQuery dataset schema and example data (graphic below)

### How to verify you've done it
 - Write and execute your queries in the BigQuery interface
  TIP: You can review the provided query answers, run those queries and compare query results


### Other Things to Know
 - If you want to set up your own copy of the example BigQuery dataset, use the CSV files provided in this Repository
  - Get your source files or data - I used a set of CSV files
    - Review the structure and the data -> format and clean data
  - Create a BigQuery dataset using the Web UI
    - In your BigQuery dataset, create a BigQuery table for each CSV file 
    - you can use BigQuery 'auto-detect' table schema IF
      - your source files use tab, comma or pipe delimeters 
      - each file must have at least one non-string column, i.e. integer, float, date
      - you can set to skip 1 row if your source data has headers
      - be aware that BigQuery INCLUDES all white space in string fields, so if you want to remove that white space you must remove it in the source file before you create your BigQuery tables
