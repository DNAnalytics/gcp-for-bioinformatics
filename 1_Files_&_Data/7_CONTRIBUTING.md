# Style Guide

We love contributions!  Here are some tips for creating contributions to this open source course.

> Use active voice, i.e. 'you will click..., you learn to create..., etc...' rather than passive voice 'clicking x results in y...'  

> Start blocks with active VERBS in all caps, i.e. 'USE..., LEARN...' , rather than 'using x does y' or 'x results in z'

> Use hierarchies and lists to convey structure, i.e. 
- 1
    - 1a
    - 1b
- 2
    - 2a
    - 2b
    - 2c
- 3
    - 3a
    - 3b

> The section headings on each page are the same by design, i.e. 

- Why do this
- What is this  
...  
- How to do this
- How to verify you've done it  
...  
- How to learn more

Keep Pull Requests small
- one PR per page at minimum
- if correcting typos 
    - make that one PR 
    - separate it from additions to the text

## Content principles
All written content should follow these principles:

* **Approachability:** Don't assume reader has prior knowledge, spell out all acronyms
* **Brevity:** Keep it simple, link to outside content for deeper dives
* **Curation:** Amplify community best practices vs. any individual's point of view

Content should maintain a quickly scanable tone. This course is meant as an introduction to using GCP services for those who are new to cloud and working in bioinformatics research.

## Mentions

When referring to people that use GitHub, use @mentions of their username instead of their full name.

- :cry: As [Jess Frazelle](https://github.com/jessfraz) put it...

When referring to a project on GitHub, link to the repository so others can dive deeper, if they choose.
