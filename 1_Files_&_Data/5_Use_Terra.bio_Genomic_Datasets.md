# Use Terra.bio Genomic Data

### Why do this

 [![terra-features](/images/terra-features.png)]()

 - Use genomic reference data in cloud-based analysis. Terra runs on GCP (capabilities shown above).
  - Use data with bioinformatics tools (GATK, Hail...) & workflows on Jupyter notebooks or run scalable analysis on GCP without manually configuring Jupyter Hub, Cloud Storage & VMs (or container clusters)

### What is this

 Use Terra reference data for analysis - the web ui in this system is shown belown

 Explore genomic reference datasets using the interactive data viewer --  shown below, to decide when they'll be useful in your analysis.

### Key considerations
- Many Terra (GCP) datasets require authenticated access.  The '1000 Genomes' dataset has public access.
- Import and use any subset of reference data in your Terra analysis (notebook or worflow)


### How to do this

See screenshots below for general flow of working with reference data and your own data in Terra.  
- **LOGIN & SETUP** -> 
  - Navigate to [Terra.bio](https://terra.bio/) --> 'Try Terra' and authenticate with your email
   - Use $300 USD in GCP credit when you first try out Terra
   - Create a Terra workspace to hold your notebooks 
- **REFERENCE DATA** -> 
  - Refer to public reference data (Terra Library -> Data) 
  - Upload your own research data for analysis (Your Terra Workspace -> Data Section)
  - Refer to data in Cloud Storage (use gs://{mybucket}/{my folder}) in your notebook
- **SETUP ANALYSIS** -> 
  - Use (or import) a Terra (Jupyter) noteook 
  - Use (or import) a Terra workflow

### How to verify you've done it
 You can preview or download your files if need be from the Terra data tab.

 For some file types, you can use the integrated IGV file viewer

### Other Things to Know
 - If you download data, you may incur GCP service charges.
