# Setup GCP Project Security


### Why do this
 - Secure your analysis data
 - Secure your GCP project resources

### What is this
 - GCP uses IAM (Identity and Access Management) objects to allow you to configure security
 - GCP makes services available as either services, APIs or services which include APIs

### Key considerations
 - Only enable services/APIs that you are using in your GCP Project
 - Consider auditing service usage by using Stackdriver logs - [link](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/exporting-stackdriver-logging-for-security-and-access-analytics)

### How to do this
 - Associate GCP IAM User accounts to GCP Roles (BigQuery User role shown below)
 - Best Practice: Use GCP-created roles.  Service-level roles include individual service permissions
 - You can create custom roles if needed

### How to verify you've done it
 - Test permissions assigned to roles/users

### Other Things to Know
 - Data is encrypted by default in Cloud Storage
 - You can use GCP service object labels to help you to indentify services instances that have different security requirements
