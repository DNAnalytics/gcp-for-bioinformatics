# Setup or Use GCP client tools


### Why do this
 - Work efficiently using the best combination of GCP client tools


### What is this
 - Understand, select and configure GCP client tools
 - Available tools include the following:
    - GCP Web UI (or console)
    - GCP shell (integrated into GCP console)
    - GCP cli - part of GCP SDK (gcloud, gsutil, bq... script tools)
    - GCP SDK - available in many programming languages, Python, Go, Java...

### Key considerations
 - Learn via console
 - Experiment via console and scripts
 - Scale via scripts 
 - Optimize using SDK language integration

### How to do this
 - Click in GCP console and/or use shell - no setup /install required
 - Download GCP SDK - use gcp cli and/or sdk for your language, requires installation and configuration

### How to verify you've done it
 - Login to GCP console
 - Verify your account
 - Verify a 'hello world' service - usually put a file in a bucket

### Other Things to Know
 - Access to the some or all of the GCP console can (and sometime should) be restricted
 - Reproducible research includes scripting GCP service configurations
 - Google has a large number of sample scripts and SDK code samples in their GitHub organizational Repos
 - IAM is 'Identity and Access Management' - this contains security objects, such as users, groups, roles and permissions
