# Use Cromwell and WDL for Pipelines

### Why do this
 - You want to use [The Broad Institute's cromwell](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell) orchestration engine to scale your analysis job
 - You want to use [The Broad's WDL (workflow definition language)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl) for cromwell to describe your tool and workflow inputs and outputs
 - Example workflow pattern shown below

### What is this
 - Scaling Compute Engine w/Google Pipelines API, cromwell and WDL
 - Here is the Pipelines API sample (using best practice for [The Broadâ€™s GATK tools](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)).
  - You have a number of choices - this article covers the items highlighted in RED SQUARES

### Key considerations
 - You use cromwell along with Google Pipelines API to manage the GCE (VM) resources for your analysis job
 - You use WDL scripts to configure the workflow inputs and outputs (for each tool used)
 - You use scripts, jar files or docker container images for each tools
 - You use JSON files to configure the input/output values for EACH job execution

### How to do this
 - [This tutorial](https://wdl-runner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GettingStarted/TutorialOverview/#tutorial-scenario) shows running a multi-stage workflow on GCP
    - The workflow is **launched** with Google Pipelines API
    - The workflow is **defined** using WDL
    - The workflow stages are **orchestrated** by cromwell
    - The workflow **runs** on multiple Compute Engine VMs
      - a master node is created for cromwell
      - cromwell submits each workflow stage as 1+ **separate pipelines**
 - Run a Broad Institute GATK best practice pipeline on Google Genomics/Pipelines API using WDL and cromwell - l[link](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/tutorials/gatk)

### How to verify you've done it
 - Review the files in the output destinations (Cloud Storage buckets) to check they match the expected results
 - Use GCP Stackdriver to monitor the overhead (CPU, memory etc...usage) for the Compute Engine VMs during job executions
