# Use Nextflow for Pipelines

### Why do this
 You want to use the Nextflow pipeline language to define and run your analysis workflow

### What is this
 Nextflow is a reactive workflow framework & DSL for writing data-intensive computational pipelines.  Run jobs on GCE or GCE/Pipelines using container images.
 - Nextflow can run on GCP or many other providers
 - Nextflow can run on GCP in two ways:
   - Run jobs on Compute Engine
   - Run jobs on Compute Engine **& Genomics Pipelines API**
  
 You have a number of choices to create and run workflows - this article covers the items highlighted in RED SQUARES

### Key considerations
- Understand core Nextflow features - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#Features)


### How to do this
 - Run RNAseq pipeline on GCP cloud shell instance - [link]()
 - Run RNAseq pipeline on Compute Engine and Cloud Storage - [link](https://cloud.google.com/genomics/docs/tutorials/nextflow)
 - Run VariantCalling pipeline w/GATK - [link](https://github.com/CRG-CNAG/CalliNGS-NF/)

### How to verify you've done it
 - Verify the output files from the examples above
 - Nextflow examples produce files in a `results` folder

### Other Things to Know
 - Test Netflow pipelines on your local machine or on GCP cloud shell 
 - Use Nextflow pipelines with other cloud vendors: AWS - [link](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/awscloud.html)
 - Nextflow is written in the [Groovy programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy) & is designed to run on [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) instances
