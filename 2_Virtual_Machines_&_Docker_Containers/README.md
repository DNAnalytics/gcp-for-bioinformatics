# Use Google Cloud Services for Virtual Machines and Docker Containers

In this section, you'll get information about using Google Cloud services for VMs and docker containers.  You'll use Google Compute Engine VMs.  Also you'll use services for docker containers including Google Kubernetes.  Additionally you'll use bioinformatics pipeline and workflow APIs to coordinate VMs and containers.  You'll also see how to create a Notebook instance VM using a GCP template, so that you can use a Jupyter notebook for your analysis job.

The sections of the reference architecture outlined in red will be covered.

Bioinformatics APIs include the following: dsub, cromwell, Terra.bio and Nextflow.io. There are a number of possible ways to construct high volume data analysis workflows or pipelines on GCP with these purpose-built APIs.  A representation is shown below.
