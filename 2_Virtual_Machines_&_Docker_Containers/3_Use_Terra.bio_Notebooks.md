# Use Terra.bio Notebooks

### Why do this

 - Use bioinformatics tools (GATK, Hail...) & workflows on Jupyter notebooks
 - Run scalable analysis on GCP without manually configuring Jupyter Hub, Cloud Storage & VMs (or container clusters)
 - Read - [The future of GATK tutorials is written in Notebooks](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/blog?id=24167)
 - Terra's key capabilities are shown below

### What is this
 
 - Use Jupyter notebooks and standard bioinformatics tools, such as [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/) or [Hail](https://hail.is/) in your analysis.  GATK concepts are shown below

 - Use Terra (Jupyter) notebooks for analysis
 - This article covers the potential ways of running analysis on GCP for the items highlighted in RED SQUARES shown below

### Key considerations
- Terra includes example notebooks using standard bioinformatics tools such as Hail
- Import and run your existing notebooks into a Terra workspace
- Configure Terra Notebook instances as needed - use the blue gear in the upper right of the Terra Notebook configuration interface
- Configure & use GCP services via Terra Notebooks (Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery...)

### How to do this

See screenshots below for general flow of working with Terra.  
- **LOGIN** -> 
  - Navigate to [Terra.bio](https://terra.bio/) --> 'Try Terra' and authenticate with your email
   - You can use $300 USD in GCP credit when you first try out Terra
- **REFERENCE DATA** -> 
  - Use public reference data (Terra Library -> Data)
  - Upload your own research data for analysis (Your Terra Workspace -> Data Section)
  - Refer to data in Cloud Storage (use gs://{mybucket}/{my folder}) in your notebook
- **START NOTEBOOK INSTANCE** -> 
  - Use (or import) a Jupyter noteook - view your notebook
  - Configure (GEAR) and start a Terra Notebook instance
  - Execute the cells in your notebook

### How to verify you've done it
 For your Terra notebook, start a notebook instance and perform your analysis in your notebook, example shown below

### Other Things to Know
 - Terra terms:
    - **Workspace** -> Container for workflow(s)
    - **Notebook** -> Jupyter notebook
    - **Reference Data** -> public reference data
    - **Workspace Data** -> your uploaded research data - the 'Data' tab in the Terra UI

      - Participant -> a person enrolled in a study
      - Sample -> a biological sample collected from a participant
      - Pair -> represents a pair of biological samples collected from a participant
      - Set -> group of Participants, Samples or Pairs
